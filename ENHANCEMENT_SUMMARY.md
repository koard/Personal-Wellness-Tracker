# Personal Wellness Tracker - Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the requested changes and enhancements to transform the current profile setup into a comprehensive AI-powered wellness system.

---

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Profile Setup Progress
- **Issue**: Shows 87% as initial progress instead of step-based calculation
- **Root Cause**: Uses field completion percentage rather than current step
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience

### 2. Loading Animation Missing
- **Issue**: No loading animation during Gemini analysis
- **Current State**: User sees static screen during API calls
- **Impact**: Poor user experience during wait times

### 3. Navigation Flow
- **Issue**: After successful analysis, stays on profile setup page
- **Expected**: Should navigate directly to dashboard
- **Impact**: User doesn't understand setup is complete

### 4. Gemini API Errors
- **Error**: "The model is overloaded. Please try again later."
- **Current Handling**: App crashes or shows generic error
- **Impact**: Blocks users from completing setup
